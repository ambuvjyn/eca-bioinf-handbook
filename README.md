# Practical Computing and Bioinformatics for Conservation and Evolutionary Genomics'


This is a bookdown project for a book I am preparing to be used for a spring 2020
course at CSU.

The formatting and stuff used [https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-crc](https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-crc) as
a skeleton.

The HTML version of the book, hosted on GitHub Pages can be found at:
