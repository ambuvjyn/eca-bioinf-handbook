# (PART) Part III: Bioinformatic Analyses {-}

# Overview of Bioinformatic Analyses

This is going to be sequence based stuff and getting
to variants.

Part IV will be "bioinformaticky" analyses that you might encounter once
you have your variants.

I think now that I will insert QC relevant to each step in that section.


Hey Eric! Find a place to put a section about bedtools in there.  It is pretty 
cool what you can do with it, even on VCF files, like coverage of a VCF file in
windows to get a sliding window of variant density.
