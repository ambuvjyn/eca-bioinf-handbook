Metacharacter(s)  &    Description 
`.`            & Match any single character
`[ ]`          & Match any single character from a _character class_ (see below)
`^`            & Signifies/matches the _beginning_ of the line or word (remember `/^@SQ/`)
`$`            & Signifies/matches the _end_ of the line of word
`*`            & Match zero or more occurrences of the character (or grouped pattern) immediately to the left
`?`            & Match zero or one occurrences of the character (or grouped pattern) immediately to the left
`+`            & Match one or more occurrences of the character (or grouped pattern) immediately to the left
`{n}`          & Match n occurrences of the character (or grouped pattern) immediately to the left

`|`            & Combine regular expressions with an OR
`\`            & Use it if you want to match a literal metacharacter.  For example `\.` matches an actual period, and `\?` matches an acutal question mark
`( )`          & Used to group characters into a single unit to which modifiers like `*` or `+` can be applied, to delimit the extent of `|`'s (or to be used in more advanced expressions for inserting replacement groups)
