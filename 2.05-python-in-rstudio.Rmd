# Using python

Many people live and breathe python.  Most conservation geneticists and most
biologists in general are probably more familiar and comfortable with R.  Nonetheless,
there are some pieces of software that are available in python and it behooves us
to know at least enough to crack those open and start using them.

Happily, the makers of RStudio have made it very easy to use python within the
RStudio IDE.  This makes the transition considerably easier.  

Topics:

- conda and installing and setting up python environments.  (What are they under
the hood?)
- the reticulate package
- step-by-step instructions.
- An example: 2Dsfs and the moments package.
