# Sed, awk, and regular expressions

In the course of doing bioinformatics, you will be dealing with myriad different
_text_ files. As we noted in the previous chapters, Unix, with its file I/O model,
piping capabilities, and numerous utilities, is well-suited to handling
large text files.  Two utilities found on every Unix installation---`awk` and `sed`---merit
special attention in this context.  `awk` is a lightweight scripting language that lets
you write succinct programs to operate line-by-by line on the contents of text files.  It is
particularly useful for handling text files that have columns of data separated by white spaces
or tabs.  `sed` on the other hand, is particularly useful for automating
"find-and-replace" operations on text files.  Each of them is optimized to
handle large files without storing a lot of information in memory, so they can be 
useful for quick operations on large bioinformatic data sets.  Neither is a fully-featured
programming language that you would want to write large, complex programs in; however they do share many of the
useful text-manipulation capabilities of such languages, such as Perl and Python.  Additionally,
`awk` and `sed` are deployed in a consistent fashion across most Unix operating systems, and they
don't require much time to learn to use effectively for common text-processing tasks.
As a consequence `awk` and `sed` are a useful addition to the bioinformatician's tookbox. 

Both `awk` and `sed` rely heavily on _regular expressions_ to describe _patterns_
in text upon which some operation should be performed.  You can think of
regular expressions as providing a succinct language for performing very advanced "find" operations
in a text file.
