# Topics in pop gen

## Coalescent

Gotta have a lecture on the coalescent.  It would be nice to try to motivate
all the topics from this backward in time perspective.

Get far enough to discuss $\pi$ and the expected site frequency spectrum.


## Measures of genetic diversity and such

It would really be good for me to write a chapter / give a few lectures
on different measures like $d_{xy}$, $F_\mathrm{ST}$.  

From Ash's paper:  However, population genomic analyses (outlined below) use FST only, as dxy was highly correlated to nucleotide diversity (π) (for early stage diverging populations the correlation between dxy and π is > 0.91, Pearson correlation). As such variation in dxy across the genome reflects variation in diversity, not differentiation (Riesch et al., 2017).

Tajima's $D$ and such.  The influence of selection on such measures.

## Demographic inference with $\partial a \partial i$ and _moments_



## Balls in Boxes

Would be worthwhile to have a review of all these sorts of variants of 
population assignment, structure, admixture, etc.

Population structure and PCAs.

finestructure and fineRADstructure.

## Some landscape genetics

After talking with Amanda about her dissertation I realized it would be good
to talk about some landscape genetics stuff.  For sure I want to talk about
EEMS and maybe CircuitScape, just so I know well what is going on with the
latter.  


## Relationship Inference

Maybe do a lecture on this...


## Tests for Selection

A look at a selection of the methods that are out there.  $F_\mathrm{ST}$ outliers, _Bayescan_, _Lositan_, _PCAdapt_, and friends.  It would be good to get a nice succinct explanation/understanding of all of these.


## Multivariate Associations, GEA, etc.

It really is time for me to wrap my head around this stuff.


## Estimating heritability in the wild

Another from Amanda.  It would be good to do some light Quant Genet so that
we all understand how we might be able to use NGS data to estimate heritability
in wild populations.
