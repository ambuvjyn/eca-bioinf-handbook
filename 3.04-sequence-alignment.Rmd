# Alignment of sequence data to a reference genome

A light treatment of how bwa works.  I think I will focus solely on bwa, unless
someone can convince me that there are cases where something like bowtie works better.

## Preprocess ?
Will have a bit about sequence pre-processing (with WGS data it already
comes demultiplexed, so maybe we can hold off on this until we get to
RAD data).
