# Authoring reproducibly with Rmarkdown

### citr and Zotero

Pretty cool, but there are some things that are sort of painful---namely
the Title vs. Sentence casing.  Fortunately, citr just adds things to your references.bib, it doesn't re-overwrote references.bib each time,
so you can edit references.bib to put titles in sentence case.  Probably want to export without braces protecting capitals.  Then it should all work.  See [this discussion](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/61715/prevent-extra-braces-in-bibtex-export).  Just be sure to version control references.bib and commit it often.

## Google Docs

This ain't reproducible research, but I really like the integration with Zotero.  Perhaps
I need a chapter which is separate from this chapter that is about disseminating results and
submitting stuff, etc.
