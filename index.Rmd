# Preface {-}

This is a collection of blurbs Eric started writing in the last year to 
help remind himself and others of some useful things to know for bioinformatics.

It was started during an extended government shutdown, when it seemed like writing a book
might be in order.  Fortunately, the shutdown ended eventually.  It is not clear whether a
book will ever come of it, but these notes shall be up on the web indefinitely, so feel free to use
them!
