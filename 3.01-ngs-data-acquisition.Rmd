# Next Generation Sequencing Data Acquisition

## Sequencing platforms
Basically talk a little about how the technologies work.

Go into paired-end vs single end reads, etc.

Strand direction.  There is a good overview on a blog at:
[http://www.cureffi.org/2012/12/19/forward-and-reverse-reads-in-paired-end-sequencing/](http://www.cureffi.org/2012/12/19/forward-and-reverse-reads-in-paired-end-sequencing/),
to start getting one's head around it.  It ends up being super 
important if you are looking for inversion
breakpoints, etc [@Corbett-DetigSequenceBasedDetectionBreakpoint2012].





## Library Prep Protocols

Gotta mention here about how barcodes work.

How you prepare your libraries dictates what type of data you get.

### WGS

### RAD-Seq methods

### Amplicon Sequencing

### Capture arrays, RAPTURE, etc.
