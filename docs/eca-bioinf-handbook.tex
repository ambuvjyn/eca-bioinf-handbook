Package names are in bold text (e.g., \textbf{rmarkdown}), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., \texttt{knitr::knit(\textquotesingle{}foo.Rmd\textquotesingle{})}). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., \texttt{bookdown::render\_book()}).

You can label chapter and section titles using \texttt{\{\#label\}} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \ref{intro}. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \ref{methods}.

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in \texttt{figure} and \texttt{table} environments, respectively.

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the \texttt{fig:} prefix, e.g., see Figure \ref{fig:nice-fig}. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from \texttt{knitr::kable()}, e.g., see Table \ref{tab:nice-tab}.

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the \textbf{bookdown} package \citep{R-bookdown} in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and \textbf{knitr} \citep{xie2015}.

And John wrote a paper: \citep{NovembreTreadLightlyInterpreting2018}

This is where I am going to just throw out ideas and start to organize them. My thought
was that while I am actually doing bioinformatics, etc. in my normal day-to-day work
I will analyze what I am doing and figure out all the different tools that I am using
and organize that or pedagogy.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note: I am going to make a companion repository called \texttt{mega-bioinf-pop-gen-examples}
  that will house all of the data sets and things for exercises.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{table-of-topics}{%
\section{Table of topics}\label{table-of-topics}}

Man! There is going to be a lot to get through. My current idea
is to meet three times a week. The basic gist of those three sessions
will be like this:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Fundamental Tools / Environments}: I am thinking 5 weeks on Unix, 1 Week on HPC, 6 Weeks on R/Rstudio, and 3 on Python from within Rstudio (so that students know enough to run python modules like moments.)
\item
  \textbf{Theory and Background}: Population-genetic and bioinformatic theory. Alignment and BW transforms, the coalescent, Fst, etc. Basically things that are needed to understand (to some degree) what various programs/analyses are doing under the hood.
\item
  \textbf{Application and Practice}: Getting the students to get their feet wet and their fingers dirty actually doing it. This time should be entirely practical, with students doing an exercise (in pairs or groups, possibly) with me (or someone else, maybe CH) overseeing.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Essential Unix/Linux Terminal Knowledge}\label{essential-unixlinux-terminal-knowledge}}

Unix was developed at AT\&T Bell Labs in the 1960s. Formally ``UNIX'' is a
trademarked operating system,
but when most people talk about ``Unix''
they are talking about the \emph{shell}, which is the text-command-driven interface
by which Unix users interact with the computer.

The Unix shell has been around, largely unchanged, for many decades because it is \emph{awesome}.
When you learn it, you aren't learning a fad, but, rather, a mode of interacting
with your computer that has been time tested and will likely
continue to be the lingua franca of large computer systems
for many decades to come.

For bioinformatics, Unix is the tool of choice for a number of reasons: 1) complex analyses
of data can be undertaken with a minimum of words; 2) Unix allows automation of tasks,
especially ones that are repeated many times; 3) the standard set of Unix commands includes
a number of tools for managing large files and for inspecting and manipulating text files; 4) multiple,
successive analyses upon a single stream of data can be expressed and executed efficiently,
typically without the need to write intermediate results to the disk;
5) Unix was developed when computers were extremely limited in terms of memory and speed. Accordingly,
many Unix tools have been well optimized and are appropriate to the massive genomic data sets
that can be taxing even for today's large, high performance computing systems; 6) virtually all state-of-the-art
bioinformatc tools are tailored to run in a Unix environment; and finally, 7) essentially
every high-performance computer cluster runs some variant of Unix, so if you are going to be
using a cluster for your analyses (which is highly likely), then you have gotta know Unix!

\emph{A paragraph about what kinds of computers run Unix. (Often big servers, but also some
flavors of personal laptops). The difference (similarities) between
Unix and Linux. You might have Unix on your system (if you have a Mac). Or not. All this
will effect what you need to do to get a Unix shell on your computer}

\hypertarget{getting-a-bash-shell-on-your-system}{%
\section{Getting a bash shell on your system}\label{getting-a-bash-shell-on-your-system}}

Talk about what a shell is.

For windows, it looks like windows 10 might be able to do pretty well with it:\\
\url{https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/}

But maybe I should get a windows box and use Rstudio and see how the terminal in R studio is.

For now, I will punt on this and get just assume POSIX available on the system.

However, we will want to start everyone off by having them type \texttt{bash} to
make sure they have a bash shell.

Also, I am going to have to talk a little bit about what a shell is here\ldots{}.

\hypertarget{navigating-the-unix-filesystem}{%
\section{Navigating the Unix filesystem}\label{navigating-the-unix-filesystem}}

Most computer users will be familiar with the idea of saving documents into ``folders.''
These folders are typically navigated using a ``point-and-click'' interface
like that of the Finder in Mac OS X or the File Explorer in a Windows system.
When working in a Unix shell, such a point-and-click interface is typically not available,
and the first hurdle that new Unix users must surmount is learning to quickly navigate in
the Unix filesystem from a terminal prompt. So,
we begin our foray into Unix and its command prompt with this essential skill.

When you start a Unix shell in a terminal window you get a \emph{command prompt}
that might look something like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{my-laptop}\NormalTok{:~ me$}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or, perhaps something as simple as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{$}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or maybe something like:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{/}\ExtensionTok{~/--%}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We will adopt the convention in this book that, unless we are intentionally doing something
fancier, the Unix command prompt is given
by a percent sign, and this will be used when displaying text typed at a command
prompt, followed by output from the command. For example

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ pwd}
\ExtensionTok{/Users/eriq}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

shows that I issued the Unix command \texttt{pwd}, which instructs the computer to
\textbf{p}rint \textbf{w}orking \textbf{d}irectory, and the computer responded by printing
\texttt{/Users/eriq}, which, on my Mac OS X system is my \emph{home directory}.
In Unix parlance, rather than speaking of ``folders,'' we call
them ``directories;'' however, the two are essentially the same thing.
Every user
on a Unix system has a home directory. It is the domain on a shared computer
in which the user has privileges to create and delete files and do work.
It is where most of your work will happen. When you are working in the Unix
shell there is a notion of a
\emph{current working directory}---that is to say, a place within the hierarchy of
directories where you are ``currently working.'' This will become more concrete
after we have encountered a few more concepts.

The specification \texttt{/Users/eriq} is what is known as an \emph{absolute path}, as it provides the
``address'' of my home directory, \texttt{eriq}, on my laptop, starting from the \emph{root}
of the filesystem. Every Unix computer system has a root directory (you can
think of it as the ``top-most'' directory in a hierarchy), and on every Unix system
this root directory always has the special name, \texttt{/}. The address
of a directory relative to the root is specified by starting with the root (\texttt{/})
and then naming each subsequent directory that you must go inside of in order to
get to the destination, each separated by a \texttt{/}. For example, \texttt{/Users/eriq}
tells us that we start at the root (\texttt{/}) and then we go into the \texttt{Users} directory
(\texttt{Users}) and then, from there, into the \texttt{eriq} directory. Note that \texttt{/} is used to mean the root
directory when at the beginning of an absolute path, but in the remainder of the path
its meaning is different: it is used merely as a separator
between directories nested within one another. Figure~\ref{fig:file-hierarchy} shows
an example hierarchy of some of the directories that are found on the author's
laptop.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{figs/file-hierarchy} 

}

\caption{A partial view of the directories on the author's laptop.}\label{fig:file-hierarchy}
\end{figure}

From this perspective it is obvious that the directory \texttt{eriq} lives inside \texttt{Users}, and also that, for example,
the absolute path of the directory \texttt{git-repos} would be \texttt{/Users/eriq/Documents/git-repos}.

Absolute paths give the precise location of a directory relative to the root of the filesystem,
but it is not always convenient, nor appropriate, to work entirely with absolute paths.
For one thing, directories that are deeply nested within many others can have long and unwieldy
absolute path names that are hard to type and can be difficult to remember. Furthermore, as we will
see later in this book, absolute paths are typically not \emph{reproducible} from one computer's
filesystem to another. Accordingly, it is more common to give the address of directories using
\emph{relative paths}. Relative paths work much like absolute paths; however, they do not start with
a leading \texttt{/}, and hence they do not take as their
starting point the root directory. Rather, their starting point is implicitly taken
to be the current working directory. Thus, if the current working directory is
\texttt{/Users/eriq}, then the path \texttt{Documents/pers} is a relative path to the
\texttt{pers} directory, as can again be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:file-hierarchy}.

The special relative path symbol \texttt{..} means ``the directory that is one level higher up
in the hierarchy.'' So, if the current working directory were \texttt{/Users/eriq/Documents/git-repos},
then the path \texttt{..} would mean \texttt{/Users/eriq/Documents}, the path
\texttt{../work} gives the directory \texttt{/Users/eriq/Documents/work}, and, by using two or more \texttt{..} symbols
separated by forward slashes, we
can even go up multiple levels in the hierarchy: \texttt{../../../zoe} is a relative path for
\texttt{/Users/zoe}, when the current working directory is \texttt{/Users/eriq/Documents/git-repos}.

When naming paths, another
useful Unix shorthand is \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} (a tilde) which denotes the user's home directory. This is particularly
useful since most of your time in a Unix filesystem will be spent in a directory within your
home directory. Accordingly, \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/Documents/work} is a quick shorthand for
\texttt{/Users/eriq/Documents/work}. This is essential practice if you are working on a large shared computing
resource in which the absolute path to your home directory might be changed by the
system administrator when restructuring the filesystem.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdtip}
\textbf{A useful piece of terminology:} in any path, the ``final'' directory
name is called the \emph{basename} of the path. Hence the basename of \texttt{/Users/eriq/Documents/git-repos}
is \texttt{git-repos}. And the basename of \texttt{../../Users} is \texttt{Users}.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdtip}

\hypertarget{changing-the-working-directory-with-cd}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Changing the working directory with \texttt{cd}}{Changing the working directory with cd}}\label{changing-the-working-directory-with-cd}}

When you begin a Unix terminal session, the current working
directory is set, by default, to your home directory. However, when you are doing
bioinformatics or otherwise hacking on the command line, you will typically
want to be ``in another directory'' (meaning you will want the current working
directory set to some other directory). For this, Unix provides the \texttt{cd} command, which
stands for \textbf{c}hange \textbf{d}irectory. The syntax is super simple:

cd \emph{path}

where \emph{path} is an absolute or a relative path. For example, to
get to the \texttt{git-repos} directory from my home directory would require
a simple command \texttt{cd\ Documents/git-repos}. Once there, I could change to
my \texttt{Desktop} directory with \texttt{cd\ ../../Desktop}. Witness:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ pwd}
\ExtensionTok{/Users/eriq}
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ cd Documents/git-repos/}
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ pwd}
\ExtensionTok{/Users/eriq/Documents/git-repos}
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ cd ../../Desktop}
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ pwd}
\ExtensionTok{/Users/eriq/Desktop}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once you have used \texttt{cd}, the working directory of your current shell will
remain the same no matter how many other commands you issue,
until you invoke the \texttt{cd} command another time and change
to a different directory.

If you give the \texttt{cd} command with no path specified, your working directory
will be set to your home directory. This is super-handy if you have been
exploring the levels of a Unix filesystem above your home directory and cannot
remember how to get back to your home directory. Just remember that

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ cd}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

will get you back home.

Another useful shortcut is to supply \texttt{-} (a hyphen) as the path to \texttt{cd}. This will
change the working directory back to where you were before your last invocation
of \texttt{cd}, and it will tell you which directory you have returned to. For example, if you start in \texttt{/Users/eriq/Documents/git-repos} and then
\texttt{cd} to \texttt{/bin}, you can get back to \texttt{git-repos} with \texttt{cd\ -} like so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ pwd}
\ExtensionTok{/Users/eriq/Documents/git-repos}
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ cd /bin/}
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ pwd}
\ExtensionTok{/bin}
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ cd -}
\ExtensionTok{/Users/eriq/Documents/git-repos}
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ pwd}
\ExtensionTok{/Users/eriq/Documents/git-repos}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note the output of \texttt{cd\ -} is the newly-returned-to current working directory.

\hypertarget{updating-your-command-prompt}{%
\subsection{Updating your command prompt}\label{updating-your-command-prompt}}

When you are buzzing around in your filesystem, it is often difficult to remember
which directory you are in. You can always type \texttt{pwd} to figure that out,
but the bash shell also provides a way to print the current working directory
\emph{within your command prompt}.

For example, the command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\VariableTok{PS1=}\StringTok{'[\textbackslash{}W]--% '}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

redefines the command prompt to be the basename of the current directory surrounded
by brackets and followed by \texttt{-\/-\%}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ pwd}
\ExtensionTok{/Users/eriq/Documents/git-repos}
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ PS1=}\StringTok{'[\textbackslash{}W]--% '}
\NormalTok{[}\ExtensionTok{git-repos}\NormalTok{]--% cd ../}
\NormalTok{[}\ExtensionTok{Documents}\NormalTok{]--% cd ../}
\NormalTok{[}\ExtensionTok{~}\NormalTok{]}\ExtensionTok{--%}\NormalTok{ cd ../}
\NormalTok{[}\ExtensionTok{Users}\NormalTok{]--% }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This can make it considerably easier to keep track of where you are in your file system.

We will discuss later how to invoke this change automatically in every terminal session
when we talk about customizing environments in Section~\ref{unix-env}.

\hypertarget{tab-completion-for-paths}{%
\subsection{TAB-completion for paths}\label{tab-completion-for-paths}}

Let's be frank\ldots{}typing path names in order to change from one directory to another can feel
awfully tedious, especially when your every neuron is screaming, ``Why can't I just have a friggin' Finder
window to navigate in!'' Do not despair. This is a normal reaction when you first start using Unix.
Fortunately, Unix file-system navigation can be made much less painful (or even enjoyable)
for you by becoming a master of \emph{TAB-completion}. Imagine the Unix shell is watching
your every keystroke and trying to guess what you are about to type. If you type the first part
of a directory name after a command like \texttt{cd} and then hit the TAB key, the shell will respond
with its best guess of how you want to complete what you are typing.

Take the file hierarchy of Figure~\ref{fig:file-hierarchy}, and imagine that we are in the root
directory. At that point, if we type \texttt{cd\ A}, the shell will think "Ooh! I'll bet they want to
change into the directory \texttt{Applications} because that is the only directory that starts with \texttt{A}. Sure enough,
if you hit TAB, the shell adds to the command line so that \texttt{cd\ A} becomes \texttt{cd\ Applications/}
and the cursor is still waiting for further input at the end of the command.
Boom! That was way easier (and more accurate) than typing all those letters after \texttt{A}.

Developing a lightning-fast TAB-completion trigger finger is, quite seriously, essential to surviving and
thriving in Unix. Use your left pinky to hit TAB. Hone your skills. Make sure you can hit TAB with your eyes
closed. TAB early and TAB often!

Once you can hit TAB instantly from within the middle of any phrase, you
will also want to understand a few simple rules of TAB completion:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If you try TAB-completing a word on the command line that is not at the beginning
  of the command line (i.e., you are typing a word after a command like \texttt{cd}), then the shell
  tries to complete the word with a \emph{directory name} or a \emph{file name}.
\item
  The shell will only complete an \emph{entire} directory or file name if the name \emph{uniquely} matches the first part of the
  path that has been entered. In our example, there were no other directories than \texttt{Applications} in \texttt{/} that start
  with \texttt{A}, so the shell was certain that we must have been going for \texttt{Applications}.
\item
  If there is more than one directory or file name that matches what you have already typed, then, the first
  time you hit TAB, nothing happens, but the \emph{second} time you hit TAB, the shell will print a list of
  names that match what you have written so far. For example, in our Figure~\ref{fig:file-hierarchy} example,
  hitting TAB after typing \texttt{cd\ \textasciitilde{}/D} does nothing. But the second time we hit TAB we get a list of
  matching names:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ cd ~/D}
\ExtensionTok{Desktop/}\NormalTok{  Documents/  Downloads/}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  So, if we are heading to \texttt{Documents} we can see that adding \texttt{oc} to our command line, to create \texttt{cd\ Doc} would be sufficient to allow the shell to
  uniquely and correctly guess where we are heading. \texttt{cd\ Doc} will TAB-complete into \texttt{cd\ Documents/}
\item
  If there are multiple directory or file names that match the current command line, and they share
  more letters than those currently on the command line, TAB-completion will complete
  the name to the end of the shared portion of the name. An example helps: let's say
  I have the following two directories with hideously long names in my \texttt{Downloads} folder:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{WIFL.rep_indiv_est.mixture_collection.count.gr8-results}
\ExtensionTok{WIFL.rep_indiv_est.mixture_collection.count-results}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  Then, TAB completing on \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/Downloads/WIFL.rep} will partially complete so that the prompt and command look like:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ cd ~/Downloads/WIFL.rep_indiv_est.mixture_collection.count}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  and hitting TAB twice gives:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ cd ~/Downloads/WIFL.rep_indiv_est.mixture_collection.count}
\ExtensionTok{WIFL.rep_indiv_est.mixture_collection.count-results}
\ExtensionTok{WIFL.rep_indiv_est.mixture_collection.count.gr8-results}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

  At this point, adding \texttt{-} and TAB completing will give the first of those directories.
\end{enumerate}

The last example shows just how much typing TAB completion can save you. So, don't be
shy about hitting that TAB key. When navigating your filesystem (or writing longer command
lines that require paths of files) you should consider hitting TAB after every 1 or 2 letters.
In routine work on the command line, probably somewhere around 25\% or more of my keystrokes
are TABs. Furthermore, a TAB is never going to execute a command, and it typically won't
complete to a path that you don't want (unless you got the first part of its name wrong), so there
isn't any risk to hitting TAB all the time.

\hypertarget{listing-the-contents-of-a-directory-with-ls}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Listing the contents of a directory with \texttt{ls}}{Listing the contents of a directory with ls}}\label{listing-the-contents-of-a-directory-with-ls}}

So far we have been focusing mostly on directories. However, directories themselves
are not particularly interesting---they are merely containers. It is the \emph{files} inside of directories
that we typically work on. The command \texttt{ls} lists the contents---typically files or
other directories---within a directory.

Invoking the \texttt{ls} command without any other arguments (without anything after it)
returns the contents of the current working directory. In our example,
if we are in \texttt{/Users} then we get:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ ls}
\ExtensionTok{eriq}\NormalTok{  zoe}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

By default, \texttt{ls} gives output in several columns of text, with the directory contents
sorted lexicographically. For example, the following is output from the \texttt{ls} command
in a directory on a remote Unix machine:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ ls}
\ExtensionTok{bam}\NormalTok{                      map-sliced-fastqs-etc.sh}
\ExtensionTok{bam-slices}\NormalTok{               play}
\ExtensionTok{bwa-run-list.txt}\NormalTok{         REDOS-map-sliced-fastqs-etc.sh}
\ExtensionTok{fastq-file-prefixes.txt}\NormalTok{  sliced}
\ExtensionTok{fqslice-22.error}\NormalTok{         slice-fastqs.sh}
\ExtensionTok{fqslice-22.log}\NormalTok{           slicer-lines.txt}
\ExtensionTok{map-etc.sh}\NormalTok{               Slicer-Logs-summary.txt}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The first line shows the command prompt and the command: \texttt{\%\ ls}, and the remainder is
the output of the command.

Invoked without any further arguments, the \texttt{ls}
command simply lists the contents of the current working directory. However,
you can also direct \texttt{ls} to list the contents of another directory by simply
adding the path (absolute or relative) of that directory on the command line. For example, continuing with
the example in Figure~\ref{fig:file-hierarchy}, when we are in the home directory (\texttt{eriq})
we can see the directories/files
contained within \texttt{Documents} like so:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{[}\ExtensionTok{~}\NormalTok{]}\ExtensionTok{--%}\NormalTok{ ls Documents}
\ExtensionTok{git-repos/}\NormalTok{   pers/   work/}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you give paths to more than one directory as arguments to \texttt{ls}, then
the contents of each directory are listed after a heading line that gives
the directory's path (as given as an argument to \texttt{ls}), followed by a colon. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{[}\ExtensionTok{~}\NormalTok{]}\ExtensionTok{--%}\NormalTok{ ls Documents/git-repos Documents/work}
\ExtensionTok{Documents}\NormalTok{/git-repos:}
\ExtensionTok{ARCHIVED_mega-bioinf-pop-gen.zip}\NormalTok{  lowergranite_0.0.1.tar.gz}
\ExtensionTok{AssignmentAdustment/}\NormalTok{              mega-bioinf-pop-gen-examples/}
\ExtensionTok{CKMRsim/}\NormalTok{                          microhaps_np/}

\ExtensionTok{Documents}\NormalTok{/work:}
\ExtensionTok{assist/}\NormalTok{          maps/            oxford/          uw_days/}
\ExtensionTok{courses_audited/}\NormalTok{ misc/            personnel/}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You might also note in the above example, that some of the paths listed within
each of the two directories are followed by a slash, \texttt{/}. This \texttt{ls} customization denotes that
they are directories themselves. Much like your command prompt, \texttt{ls} can be customized in ways
that make its output more informative. We will return to that in Section~\ref{unix-env}.

If you pass the path of a file to \texttt{ls}, and that file exists in your filesystem,
then \texttt{ls} will respond by printing the file's path:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ ls Documents/git-repos/lowergranite_0.0.1.tar.gz }
\ExtensionTok{Documents/git-repos/lowergranite_0.0.1.tar.gz}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If the file does not exist you get an error message to that effect:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{%}\NormalTok{ ls Documents/try-this-name}
\ExtensionTok{ls}\NormalTok{: Documents/try-this-name: No such file or directory}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The multi-column, default output of \texttt{ls} is useful when you want
to scan the contents of a directory, and quickly see as many files
as possible in the fewest lines of output.
However, this output format is not well
structured. For example, you don't know how many columns are going to be used in
the default output of \texttt{ls} (that
depends on the length of the filenames and the width of your terminal), and it
offers little information beyond the names of the files.

You can tell the \texttt{ls} command to provide more information, by using it with the \texttt{-l}
option. Appropriately, with the \texttt{-l} option, the \texttt{ls} command will return
output in \emph{long} format:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

Each row contains information about only a single file.
The first column indicates what kind of file
each entry is, and also tells us which users have permission to
do certain things with the file (more on this in a few sections).
The third and fourth columns show that the owner of
each file is \texttt{eriq}, who is a user in the group called \texttt{kruegg}. After that
is the size of the file (in bytes) and the date and time it was last modified.

There are a few options to \texttt{ls} that are particularly useful. One is \texttt{-a}, which causes
\texttt{ls} to include in its listing all files, even \emph{hidden} ones. In a Unix file system,
any file whose name starts with a \texttt{.} is considered a \emph{hidden} file. Commonly, such
files are configuration files or other files used by programs that you typically
don't interact with directly. (We will see an example of this when we start working with \texttt{git} for version control, Section~\ref{git-workings}.) The \texttt{-d} option for \texttt{ls} is also'
quite handy. Recall that when you provide the name of a directory as an argument to \texttt{ls},
the default behavior is to list the contents of the directory. This can be troublesome
when you are listing the contents of a subdirectory: \texttt{ls\ \textasciitilde{}/Documents/git-repos/*} lists the

\hypertarget{globbing}{%
\subsection{Globbing}\label{globbing}}

If you have ever had to move a large number of files of a certain type from
one folder to another in a Finder window, you know that individually clicking and
selecting each one and then dragging them can be a tedious task (not to mention the disaster
that ensues if you slip on your mouse and end up dropping all the files some place
you did not intend). Unix provides a wonderful system called \emph{filename expansion} or
``globbing'' for quickly providing the names of a large number of files and paths which let's
you operate on multiple files quickly and efficiently. In short, globbing allows for
\emph{wildcard matching} in path names. This means that you can
specify multiple files that have names that share a common part, but differ in other parts.

The most widely used (and the most permissive) wildcard is the asterisk, \texttt{*}. It matches
anything in a file name. So, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{*.vcf} will expand to any files in the current directory with the suffix \texttt{.vcf}.
\item
  \texttt{D*s} will expand to any files that start with an uppercase \texttt{D} and end with an \texttt{s}.
\item
  \texttt{*output-*.txt} will expand to any files that include the phrase \texttt{output-} somewhere
  in their name and also end with \texttt{.txt}.
\item
  \texttt{*} will expand to all files in the current working directory.
\item
  \texttt{/usr/local/*/*.sh} will expand to any files ending in \texttt{.sh} that reside within any directory that
  is within the \texttt{/usr/local} directory.
\end{itemize}

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdnote}
\textbf{Actually, there is some arcana here:} Names of files or directories that start with a
dot (a period) will not expand unless the
dot is included explicitly. Files with names starting with a dot are
``hidden'' files in Unix. You also will not see them in the results of \texttt{ls}, unless you
use the \texttt{-a} option: \texttt{ls\ -a}.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdnote}

After the asterisk, the next most commonly-used wildcard is the question mark, \texttt{?}.

Should make it clear that this is not something unique only to ls.
All that ls is doing is listing its arguments. The expansion happens
on the command line.

Gonna have to talk about \texttt{-l} and \texttt{-a} options. Maybe talk about -d, which is useful.

\hypertarget{what-makes-a-good-file-name}{%
\subsection{What makes a good file-name?}\label{what-makes-a-good-file-name}}

If the foregoing discussion suggests to you that it might not be good to use an
actual \texttt{*}, \texttt{?}, \texttt{{[}}, or \texttt{\{} in names that you give to files and directories
on your Unix system, then congratulations on your intuition! Although you can use
such characters in your filenames, they have to be preceded by a backslash, and it
gets to be a huge hassle. So don't use them in your file names. Additionally,
characters such as \texttt{\#}, \texttt{\textbar{}}, and \texttt{:} do not play well for file names. Don't use them!

Another pet peeve of mine (and anyone who uses Unix) are file names that have spaces in them.
In Windows and on a Mac it is easy to create file names that have spaces in them. In fact, the
standard Windows system comes with such space-containing directory names as \texttt{My\ Documents} or \texttt{My\ Pictures}. Yikes! Please \emph{don't ever do that in your Unix life!} One can deal with spaces in file
names, but there is really no reason to include spaces in your file names, and having spaces in file
names will typically break a good many scripts. Rather than a space, use an underscore, \texttt{\_}, or a
dash, \texttt{-}. You've gotta admit that, not only does \texttt{My-Documents} work better, but it actually
looks better too!

So, to make your life easier, the bottom line is that you should name your files
on a Unix system using only upper- and lowercase letters (Unix file systems are
case-sensitive), numerals, and the following three punctuation characters: \texttt{.}, \texttt{-}, and \texttt{\_}.
Though you can use other punctuation characters, they often require special treatment, and it
is better to avoid them altogether.

This is going to be a chapter on using High Performance Computing clusters.

There is a lot to convey here about using queues and things.

I know SGE pretty well at this point, but others might use slurm.

I guess I'll have to see what the CSU students have access to.

\hypertarget{accessing-remote-computers}{%
\section{Accessing remote computers}\label{accessing-remote-computers}}

Start off with some stuff about ssh and scp.

Maybe have a section on public and private keys so you don't have to put
your password in every time (I would like to get better with that,
as well).

Here is the deal on that. On a mac, you can use

\begin{verbatim}
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
\end{verbatim}

and be sure to give it a password, so that your private key is not unencrypted.
For, if it is, then there is a chance (I do believe) that if someone were to
obtain that file, they could gain access to all the computers you are authorized on.

Note that a lot of tutorials on the web have you generating a private key without
any encryption. That is lame.

Then copy the .ssh/id\_rsa.pub key to the .ssh/authorized\_keys file on the server
(creating it if it needs to be there). Then ssh to the server and your Mac will pop
up a window asking for a password or will prompt on the command line for one (note that the password stays local!). You put in
the password that you used when you created the private key. That
can be saved in the Mac keychain (on old version of OSX you might
get asked if you want to save it in the Mac keychain). Voila!
Now you have access to the server with no need to type a password in there.

Note, since Sierra, you need to add this to a \texttt{.ssh/config} file to get the password
stored in the keychain:

\begin{verbatim}
Host *
   AddKeysToAgent yes
   UseKeychain yes     
\end{verbatim}

And, it turns out that you also need to make sure the permissions on that
file are set appropriately:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{chmod}\NormalTok{ 600 ~/.ssh/config}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It is actually pretty darn simple\ldots{}

Note, to have access from another computer to the server, you probably just create
a keypair for that computer, and add the public key to the authorized\_keys.

Then add something like this to your .bashrc:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# for quick ssh to hoffman}
\BuiltInTok{alias}\NormalTok{ hoffy=}\StringTok{'ssh eriq@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu'}

\CommentTok{# to be used in scp.  like scp file $hoff:~/}
\VariableTok{hoff=}\NormalTok{eriq}\ExtensionTok{@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that this should only be done on a private computer account, not on a shared account on a computer.
Otherwise, everyone using that account will have access.

Also, an interesting thing to investigate might be SSHF/FUSE which just might
let one mount the HPC filesystem on a local directory, so you can work with
files there using RStudio, etc, get them all debugged, and then run them.

Check out some information about that here:
\url{https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sshfs-to-mount-remote-file-systems-over-ssh}.

I went to \url{https://osxfuse.github.io/} and I downloaded SSHFS 2.5.0 and FUSE for Mac OS X. Then I installed them,
doing a simple default install for each.

Then, you make a mountpoint, which you can do in your home directory if you want:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mkdir}\NormalTok{ ~/hoffman  # this is the mountpoint}
\ExtensionTok{sshfs}\NormalTok{ -o allow_other,defer_permissions,IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_rsa eriq@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:/u/home/e/eriq/  ~/hoffman}

\CommentTok{# close it out:}
\FunctionTok{umount}\NormalTok{ ~/hoffman/}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that the absolute path to my home folder there seemed to be important.

Also, I can't get to \texttt{/u/nobackup/kruegg/eriq} from here by going through the symlink in my home directory
on hoffman, since that is essentially a different volume. But I should
be able to do this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{sshfs}\NormalTok{ -o allow_other,defer_permissions,IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_rsa eriq@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:/u/nobackup/kruegg/eriq  ~/hoffman}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Yep! that works. And I can open all those files from within RStudio. Cool.

Note, I will have to have a separate mount point for \$SCRATCH as well.

Shoot! That works really seamlessly!

I can also add to my .bashrc:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{alias}\NormalTok{ hoffuse=}\StringTok{'sshfs -o allow_other,defer_permissions,IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_rsa eriq@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:/u/nobackup/kruegg/eriq  ~/hoffman'}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now, the bad news: you can open an Rstudio project from that remote, mounted volume, but it
doesn't seem to really work. It is incredibly slow, and then fails to quit properly, etc.

After force-quitting it, I am unable to unmount the hoffuse volume. What a mess. OK, I probably
won't try (running the rstudio project over FUSE). But it might be useful still for editing
small things.

\hypertarget{interfacing-with-the-cloud}{%
\subsection{Interfacing with ``The Cloud''}\label{interfacing-with-the-cloud}}

Increasingly, data scientists and tech companies alike are keeping their
data ``in the cloud.'' This means that they
pay a large tech firm like Amazon, Dropbox, or Google to store their data for them in
a place that can be accessed via the internet. There are many advantages to this
model. For one thing, the company that serves the data often will create multiple copies
of the data for backup and redundancy: a fire in a single data center is not a calamity
because the data are also stored elsewhere, and can often be accessed seamlessly from those
other locations with no apparent disruption of service. For another, companies that are
in the business of storing and serving
data to multiple clients have data centers that are well-networked, so that getting
data onto and off of their storage systems can be done very quickly over the internet
by an end-user with a good internet connection.

Five years ago, the idea of storing next generation sequencing data might have
sounded a little
crazy---it always seemed a laborious task getting the data off of the remote server at the
sequencing center, so why not just keep the data in-house once you have it?
To be sure, keeping a copy of your
data in-house still can make sense for long-term data archiving needs, but, today, cloud
storage for your sequencing data can make a lot of sense. A few reasons are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Transferring your data from the cloud to the remote HPC system
  that you use to process the data can be very fast.
\item
  As above, your data can be redundantly backed up.
\item
  If your institution (university, agency, etc.) has an agreement with a cloud storage
  service that provides you with unlimited storage and free network access, then storing
  your sequencing data in the cloud will cost considerably less than buying a dedicated
  large system of hard drives for data backup. (One must wonder if service
  agreements might not be at risk of renegotiation if many researchers start using their
  unlimited institutional cloud storage space to store and/or archive their
  next generation sequencing data sets. My own agency's contract with Google runs
  through 2021\ldots{}but I have to think that these services are making plenty of money, even
  if a handful of researchers store big sequence data in the cloud. Nonetheless, you
  should be careful not to put multiple copies of data sets, or intermediate files that
  are easily regenerated, up in the cloud.)
\item
  If you are a PI with many lab members wishing to access the same data set, or even if
  you are just a regular Joe/Joanna researcher but you wish to share your data, it is
  possible to effect that using your cloud service's sharing settings. We will discuss
  how to do this with Google Drive.
\end{enumerate}

There are clearly advantages to using the cloud, but one small hurdle remains. Most
of the time, working in an HPC environment, we are using Unix, which provides a consistent
set of tools for interfacing with other computers using SSH-based protocols (like \texttt{scp}
for copying files from one remote computer to another). Unfortunately, many common
cloud storage services do not offer an SSH based interface. Rather, they typically process
requests from clients using an HTTPS protocol. This protocol, which effectively runs the
world-wide web, is a natural choice for cloud services that most people will access
using a web browser; however, Unix does not traditionally come with a utility or command
to easily process the types of HTTPS transactions needed to network with
cloud storage. Furthermore, there must be some security when it comes to accessing
your cloud-based storage---you don't want anyone to be able to access your files, so
your cloud service needs to have some way of authenticating people
(you and your labmates for example) that are authorized to access your data.

These problems have been overcome by a utility called \texttt{rclone}, the product of a
comprehensive open-source software project that brings the functionality of the
\texttt{rsync} utility (a common Unix tool used to synchronize and mirror file systems)
to cloud-based storage. (Note: \texttt{rclone} has nothing to do with the R programming
language, despite its name that looks like an R package.)
Currently \texttt{rclone} provides a consistent interface for accessing
files from over 35 different cloud storage providers, including Box, Dropbox, Google Drive,
and Microsoft OneDrive. Binaries for \texttt{rclone} can be downloaded for your desktop
machine from \url{https://rclone.org/downloads/}. We will
talk about how to install it on your HPC system later.

Once \texttt{rclone} is installed and in your \texttt{PATH}, you invoke it in your terminal
with the command \texttt{rclone}. Before we get into the details of the various \texttt{rclone} subcommands,
it will be helpful to take a glance at the information \texttt{rclone} records when it
configures itself to talk to your cloud service. To do so, it creates a file called \texttt{\textasciitilde{}/.config/rclone/rclone.conf}, where it stores information about all the different
connections to cloud services you have set up. For example, that
file on my system looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
[gdrive-rclone]
type = drive
scope = drive
root_folder_id = 1I2EDV465N5732Tx1FFAiLWOqZRJcAzUd
token = {"access_token":"bs43.94cUFOe6SjjkofZ","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"1/MrtfsRoXhgc","expiry":"2019-04-29T22:51:58.148286-06:00"}
client_id = 2934793-oldk97lhld88dlkh301hd.apps.googleusercontent.com
client_secret = MMq3jdsjdjgKTGH4rNV_y-NbbG
\end{verbatim}

In this configuration:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{gdrive-rclone} is the name by which rclone refers to this cloud storage location
\item
  \texttt{root\_folder\_id} is the ID of the Google Drive folder that can be thought of as the root directory of \texttt{gdrive-rclone}. This ID is not the simple name of that directory on
  your Google Drive, rather it is the unique name given by Google Drive to that directory.
  You can see it by navigating in your browser to the directory you want and finding it
  after the last slash in the URL. For example, in the above case, the URL is:
  \texttt{https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1I2EDV465N5732Tx1FFAiLWOqZRJcAzUd}
\item
  \texttt{client\_id} and \texttt{client\_secret} are like a username and a shared secret that \texttt{rclone} uses
  to authenticate the user to Google Drive as who they say they are.
\item
  \texttt{token} are the credentials used by \texttt{rclone} to make requests of Google Drive on the basis
  of the user.
\end{itemize}

Note: the above does not include my
real credentials, as then anyone could use them to access my Google Drive!

To set up your own configuration file to use Google Drive, you will use the \texttt{rclone\ config}
command, but before you do that, you will want to wrangle a client\_id from Google. Follow
the directions at \url{https://rclone.org/drive/\#making-your-own-client-id}. Things are a little different from in their step
by step, but you can muddle through to get to a screen with a client\_ID and a client
secret that you can copy onto your clipboard.

Once you have done that, then run \texttt{rclone\ config} and follow the prompts. A
typical session of \texttt{rclone\ config} for Google Drive access is given
\href{https://rclone.org/drive/}{here}. Don't choose to do the advanced setup; however
do use ``auto config,'' which will bounce up a web page and let you authenticate rclone
to your Google account.

\hypertarget{basic-maneuvers}{%
\subsubsection{Basic Maneuvers}\label{basic-maneuvers}}

The syntax for use is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{rclone}\NormalTok{ [options] subcommand  parameter1 [parameter 2...]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The ``subcommand'' part tells \texttt{rclone} what you want to do, like \texttt{copy} or \texttt{sync}, and
the ``parameter'' part of the above syntax is typically a path
specification to a directory or a file. In using rclone to access the
cloud there is not a root directory, like \texttt{/} in Unix. Instead, each remote
cloud access point is treated as the root directory, and you refer to it
by the name of the configuration followed by a colon. In our example,
\texttt{gdrive-rclone:} is the root, and we don't need to add a \texttt{/} after it to
start a path with it. Thus \texttt{gdrive-rclone:this\_dir/that\_dir} is a
valid path for \texttt{rclone} to a location on my Google Drive.

Very often when moving, copying, or syncing files, the parameters
consist of:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{source-directory  destination-directory}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

One very important point is that, unlike the Unix commands \texttt{cp} and \texttt{mv}, rclone
likes to operate on directories, not on multiple named files.

A few key subcommands:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{ls}, \texttt{lsd}, and \texttt{lsl} are like \texttt{ls}, \texttt{ls\ -d} and \texttt{ls\ -l}
\end{itemize}

\item
  \texttt{copy}: copy the \emph{contents} of a source \emph{directory} to a destination \emph{directory}. One super cool
  thing about this is that \texttt{rclone} won't re-copy files that are already on the destination and which
  are identical to those in the source directory.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{rclone}\NormalTok{ copy bams gdrive-rclone:NOFU/bams}

Note that the destination directory will be created if it does not already exist.\\
- \texttt{sync}: make the contents of the destination directory look just like the
contents of the source directory. \emph{WARNING} This will delete files in the destination
directory that do not appear in the source directory.

A few key options:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{-\/-dry-run}: don't actually copy, sync, or move anything. Just tell me what you would have done.
\item
  \texttt{-P}, \texttt{-v}, \texttt{-vv}: give me progress information, verbose output, or super-verbose output, respectively.
\item
  \texttt{-\/-tpslimit\ 10}: don't make any more than 10 transactions a second with Google Drive (should always be used when transferring files)
\item
  \texttt{-\/-\/-fast-list}: combine multiple transactions together. Should always be used with Google Drive,
  especially when handling lots of files.
\item
  \texttt{-\/-drive-shared-with-me}: make the ``root'' directory a directory that shows all
  of the Google Drive folders that people have shared with you. This is key for accessing
  folders that have been shared with you.
\end{itemize}

For example, try something like:

\hypertarget{feel-free-to-make-lots-of-configurations}{%
\subsubsection{Feel free to make lots of configurations}\label{feel-free-to-make-lots-of-configurations}}

You might want to configure a remote for each directory-specific project.
You can do that by just editing the configuration file. For example,
if I had a directory deep within my Google Drive, inside a chain of folders that
looked like, say, \texttt{Projects/NGS/Species/Salmon/Chinook/CentralValley/WinterRun}
where I was keeping
all my data on a project concerning winter-run Chinook salmon, then it would be
quite inconvenient to type \texttt{Projects/NGS/Species/Salmon/Chinook/CentralValley/WinterRun}
every time I wanted to copy or sync something within that directory. Instead,
I could add the following
lines to my configuration file, essentially copying the existing configuration and
then modifying the configuration name and the \texttt{root\_folder\_id} to be the
Google Drive identifier for the folder \texttt{Projects/NGS/Species/Salmon/Chinook/CentralValley/WinterRun} (which
one can find by navigating to that folder in a web browser and pulling the ID from the
end of the URL.) The updated configuration could look like:

\begin{verbatim}
[gdrive-winter-run]
type = drive
scope = drive
root_folder_id = 1MjOrclmP1udhxOTvLWDHFBVET1dF6CIn
token = {"access_token":"bs43.94cUFOe6SjjkofZ","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"1/MrtfsRoXhgc","expiry":"2019-04-29T22:51:58.148286-06:00"}
client_id = 2934793-oldk97lhld88dlkh301hd.apps.googleusercontent.com
client_secret = MMq3jdsjdjgKTGH4rNV_y-NbbG
\end{verbatim}

As long as the directory is still within the same Google Drive account, you can re-use
all the authorization information, and just change the \texttt{{[}name{]}} part and the \texttt{root\_folder\_id}.
Now this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{rclone}\NormalTok{ copy src_dir gdrive-winter-run: }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

puts items into \texttt{Projects/NGS/Species/Salmon/Chinook/CentralValley/WinterRun} on the Google Drive
without having to type that God-awful long path name.

\subsubsection{Installing rclone on a remote machine without sudo access}\label{installing-rclone-on-a-remote-machine-without-sudo-access}}

The instructions on the website require root access. You don't have to have root
access to install rclone locally in your home directory somewhere.
Copy the download link from \url{https://rclone.org/downloads/} for
the type of operating system your remote machine uses (most likely Linux if it is a cluster).
Then transfer that with \texttt{wget}, unzip it and put the binary in your PATH. It will look
something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
wget https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
cp rclone-current-linux-amd64/rclone ~/bin

This is a variant of rsync that let's you sync stuff up to google drive. It might be a better
solution than rcp for getting stuff onto and off of google drive. Here is a link:
\url{https://rclone.org/}. I need to evaluate it. It might also be a good way
to backup some of my workstuff on my laptop to Google Drive (and maybe also for other people to create replicas and have a decent backup if they have unlimited Google Drive storage).

I got this working. It is important to set your own OAuth client ID:
\url{https://forum.rclone.org/t/very-slow-sync-to-google-drive/6903}

After that I did like this:

\begin{verbatim}
rclone sync -vv --tpslimit 10 --fast-list Otsh_v1.0_genomic.fna  gdrive-rclone:spoogee-spoogee
\end{verbatim}

which did 2 Gb of fasta into the spoogee-spoogee directory pretty quickly.

But, with something that has lots of files, it took longer:

\begin{verbatim}
# this is only about 100 Mb but took a long time
rclone copy -P --tpslimit 10 --fast-list  rubias  gdrive-rclone:rubias
\end{verbatim}

However, once that is done, you can sync it and it finds that parts that have changed pretty quickly.

it appears to do that by file modification times:

So, for moving big files around that might be a good way forward. I will have to do a test with some big files.

And I need to test it with team drives so that multiple individuals can pull stuff off of the Bird Genoscape drive for example.

And then I just put my config file from my laptop on there. I just pasted the stuff
in whilst emacsing it. Holy cow! That is super easy.

Note that the config file is where you can also set default options like tpslimit and fast-list I think.

So, the OAuth stuff is all stored in that config file. And if you can set it up on one machine you can
go put it on any others that you want. That is awesome.

Inevitably you will want to use a piece of software that is not available as
a module or is not otherwise installed on they system.

Typically these software programs have a frightful web of dependencies.

Unix/Linux distros typically maintain all these dependencies as libraries or packages
that can be installed using a \texttt{rpm} or \texttt{yum}. However, the simple ``plug-and-play'' approach
to using these programs requires have administrator privileges so that the software can
be installed in one of the (typically protected) paths in the root (like \texttt{/usr/bin}).

But, you can use these programs to install packages into your home directory. Once you have done
that, you need to let your system know where to look for these packages when it needs them
(i.e., when running a program or \emph{linking} to it whilst compiling up a program that uses it
as a dependency.

Hoffman2 runs CentOS. Turns out that CentOS uses \texttt{yum} as a package manager.

\hypertarget{job-arrays}{%
\section{Job arrays}\label{job-arrays}}

Definitely mention the \texttt{eval} keyword in bash for when you want to print
command lines with redirects.

Show the routine for it, and develop a good approach to efficiently
orchestrating redos. If you know the taskIDs of the ones that failed
then it is pretty easy to write an awk script that picks out the
commands and puts them in a new file. Actually, it is probably
better to just cycle over the numbers and use the -t option
to launch each. Then there is now changing the job-ids file.

In fact, I am starting to think that the -t option is better than
putting it into the file.

Question: if you give something on the command line, does that override
the directive in the header of the file? If so, then you don't even
need to change the file. Note that using the qsub command line options
instead of the directives really opens up a lot of possibilities for
writing useful scripts that are flexible.

Also use short names for the jobs and have a system for naming the
redos (append numbers so you know which round it is, too)
possibly base the name on the ways things failed the first time. Like,
\texttt{fsttf1} = ``Fst run for things that failed due to time limits, 1''. Or
structure things so that redos can just be done by invoking it with -t
and the jobid.

One thing to note---sometimes processes go awry for one reason or another.
When things are in smaller chunks it is not such a huge investment to
re-run it. (Unlike stuff that runs for two weeks before you realize that
it ain't working right).

\section{Organizing big projects}\label{organizing-big-projects}}

By ``big'' I mean something like the chinook project, or your typical thing this is
a chapter in a dissertation or a paper.

I think it is useful for number things in order on a three-digit system, and
at the top of each make directories \texttt{outputs} and \texttt{intermediates}, like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{dir.create}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{file.path}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"outputs"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"intermediates"}\NormalTok{), }\StringTok{"203"}\NormalTok{), }\DataTypeTok{recursive =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{showWarnings =} \OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

I had previously used two variables \texttt{output\_dir} and \texttt{interm\_dir} to specify these in each
notebook, but now I think it would be better to just hardwire those, for a few reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Sometimes you are working on two notebooks at once in the same environment and you
  don't want to get confused about where things should get written.
\item
  You can't use those variables in shell blocks of code, where you will just have
  to write the paths out anyway.
\item
  Hard-wiring the paths forces you to think about the fact that once you establish
  the name for something, you should not change it, ever.
\item
  Hard-wiring the paths makes it easy to identify access to those different files. In particular
  you can write an R script that rips through all the lines of code in the Rmds (and R files) in your
  project and records all the instances of writing and reading of files from the outputs and intermediates
  directories. If you do this, you can make a pretty cool dependency graph so that you can visualize
  what you need to keep to clean things up for a final reproducible project. \emph{Note: I should
  write a little R package that can analyze such dependencies in a project. Unless there is
  already something like that. (Note that these are not package dependencies, but, rather, internal
  project dependencies. Note that if one is consistent with using readr functions it would be
  pretty easy to find all those instances of \texttt{read\_*} and \texttt{write\_*} and that makes it clear
  why standardized syntax like that is so useful.} Hey! Notice that this type of analysis
  would be made simple if we just focused on dependencies between different Rmds. That is
  probably the level we want to keep it at as well. Ideally you can make a graph of all files
  that are output from one Rmd and read into another. That would be a fun graph to make of the
  Chinook project.
\item
  Note. You should keep 900-999 as 100 slots for Rnotebooks for the final reproducible project
  to go with a publication. So, you can pare down all the previous notebooks and things.
\item
  Hey! Sometimes you are going to want to write or read files that have been auto-produced.
  For example, if you are cycling over chromosomes, you might have output files that start
  something like: \texttt{outputs/302/chromo\_output\_}. So, when generating those names,
  make sure that the full prefix is in there, and has a trailing underscore. Then
  you can still find it with a regex search, and also recognize it as a
  signifying a class of output files.

Basically want to highlight why it can be so useful for bioinformatic
data (and also some of the limitations with really large data sets).

(But, once you have whittled bams and vcfs down to things like GWAS results
and tables of theta values, they dplyr is totally up for the job.)

A really key concept here is going to be the relational data model
(e.g.~tidy data) and how it is so much better for handling data.

A superpowerful example of this is provided by \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytree/vignettes/tidytree.html}{tidytree}
which allows one to convert from phylo objects to a tidy object: Shoot! that
is so much easier to look at! This is a great example of how a single approach
to manipulating data works so well for other things that have traditionally not been
manipulated that way (and as a conseqence have been completely opaque for
a long time to most people.)

Cool. I should definitely have a chapter on tidy trees and ggtree.

What I really want to stress is that the syntax of the tidyverse is such
that it makes programming a relaxing and enjoying experience.

Here is a pro-tip. First, number your notebooks and have outputs and intermediates directories

Pretty cool, but there are some things that are sort of painful---namely
the Title vs.~Sentence casing. Fortunately, citr just adds things to your references.bib, it doesn't re-overwrote references.bib each time,
so you can edit references.bib to put titles in sentence case. Probably want to export without braces protecting capitals. Then it should all work. See \href{https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/61715/prevent-extra-braces-in-bibtex-export}{this discussion}. Just be sure to version control references.bib and commit it often. Though, you might want to go back and edit stuff in your Zotero library.

\hypertarget{using-python}{%

Many people live and breathe python. Most conservation geneticists and most
biologists in general are probably more familiar and comfortable with R. Nonetheless,
there are some pieces of software that are available in python and it behooves us
to know at least enough to crack those open and start using them.

Happily, the makers of RStudio have made it very easy to use python within the
RStudio IDE. This makes the transition considerably easier.

Topics:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  conda and installing and setting up python environments. (What are they under
  the hood?)
\item
  the reticulate package
\item
  step-by-step instructions.

I think now that I will insert QC relevant to each step in that section.

Hey Eric! Find a place to put a section about bedtools in there. It is pretty
cool what you can do with it, even on VCF files, like coverage of a VCF file in
windows to get a sliding window of variant density.

to do this in a consistent fashion that lets us correctly and precisely compare
one sequence of DNA to another we need to know how DNA ``works'' and we require some
conventions.

Talk about the fact that it is double-stranded, and hence there is a reverse complement.

Genome references and forward vs reverse strand stuff.

\hypertarget{sequencing-platforms}{%

Strand direction. There is a good overview on a blog at:

to start getting one's head around it. It ends up being super

Have a discussion here about naming positions within the genome

\hypertarget{variants}{%
\section{Variants}\label{variants}}

In terms of the format/standard, is going to be well worth explaining the early
part of section 5 of the standard so that people know how insertions and deletions
are coded. I hadn't really digested that until just today. Basically, the position
in the VCF file correponds to the first character in either the REF or the ALT field.\\
When you remember that, it all falls into place.

VCF. I've mostly used vcftools until now, but I've gotta admit that the interface
is awful with all the --recode BS. Also, it is viciously slow. So, let's just
skip it all together and learn how to use bcftools. One nice thing about
bcftools is that it works a whole lot like samtools, syntactically.

Note that for a lot of the commands you need to have an indexed vcf.gz.

\hypertarget{preprocess}{%

Will have a bit about sequence pre-processing (with WGS data it already

put that in a separate chapter of ``preliminaries''

\hypertarget{read-groups}{%
\section{Read Groups}\label{read-groups}}

Gotta talk about this and make it relevant to conservation. i.e.~maybe one individual was sampled with blood and also with tissue and each of those were included in four different library preps, etc. Give an example that makes it
clear how it works.

\hypertarget{merging-bam-files}{%
\section{Merging BAM files}\label{merging-bam-files}}

There is a lot of discussion on biostars about how samtools does not reconstruct the
\texttt{@RG} dictionary. But I think that this must be a problem with an older version. The
newer version works just fine. That said, Picard's MergeSamFiles seems to be just about
as fast (in fact, faster. For a comparably sized file it took 25 minutes, and gives informative
output telling you where it is at). And samtools merge is at well over 30 and only about
3/4 of the way through. Ultimately it took 37 minutes. Might have been on a slower machine\ldots{}

However, if you have sliced your fastqs and mapped each separately, then
samtools let's you not alter duplicate read group IDs, and so you can merge
those all together faithfully, as I did in the impute project. Cool.

\hypertarget{divide-and-conquer-strategies}{%

way forward, at the moment. Can be useful, but is also
fraught with peril.

\hypertarget{processing-amplicon-sequencing-data}{%
\chapter{Processing amplicon sequencing data}\label{processing-amplicon-sequencing-data}}

Super high read depths can cause problems for some pipelines.

I am going to mostly focus on short amplicons that are less than the
number of sequencing cycles, and how we create microhaps out of those, and
the great methods we have for visualizing and curating those.

\hypertarget{genome-annotation}{%
\chapter{Genome Annotation}\label{genome-annotation}}

I don't intend this to be a treatise on how to actually annotate a genome.
Presumably, that is a task that involves feeding a genome and a lot of mRNA
transcripts into a pipeline that then makes gene models, etc. I guess I could
talk a little about that process, 'cuz it would be fun to learn more about it.

However, I will be more interested in understanding what annotation data look like
(i.e.~in a GFF file) and how to associate it with SNP data (i.e.~using snpEff).

The GFF format is a distinctly hierarchical format, but it is still tabular,
it is not in XML, thank god! 'cuz it is much easier to parse in tabular format.

You can fiddle it with bedtools.

Here is an idea for a fun thing for me to do: Take a big chunk of chinook GFF
(and maybe a few other species), and then figure out who the parents are of each of the
rows, and then make a graph (with dot) showing all the different links (i.e.~gene -\textgreater{} mRNA -\textgreater{} exon -\textgreater{} CDS)
etc, and count up the number of occurrences of each, in order to get a sense of what
sorts of hierarchies a typical GFF file contains.

\hypertarget{whole-genome-alignment-strategies}{%

\hypertarget{mapping-of-scaffolds-to-a-closely-related-genome}{%
\section{Mapping of scaffolds to a closely related genome}\label{mapping-of-scaffolds-to-a-closely-related-genome}}

I basically want to get my head fully around how SatsumaSynteny works.

After that, we might as well talk about how to get in and modify a VCF file to reflect the new positions and such. (It seems we could even add something to the INFO field that listed its position in the old scaffold system. awk + vcftools sort seems like it might be the hot ticket.)

\hypertarget{obtaining-ancestral-states-from-an-outgroup-genome}{%
\section{Obtaining Ancestral States from an Outgroup Genome}\label{obtaining-ancestral-states-from-an-outgroup-genome}}

For many analyses it is helpful (or even necessary) to have a guess at the ancestral
state of each DNA base in a sequence. These ancestral states are often guessed to be the
state of a closely related (but outgroup) species. The idea there is that it is rare for
the same nucleotide to experience a substitution (or mutation) in each species, so the
base carried by the outgroup is assumed to be the ancestral sequence.

So, that is pretty straightforward conceptually, but there is plenty of hardship
along the way to do this. There are two main problems:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Aligning the outgroup genome (as a query) to the target genome. This typically
  produces a multiple alignment format (MAF) file. So, we have to understand that
  file format. (read about it \href{http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat\#format5}{here}, on the
  UCSC genome browser site.) A decent program to do this alignment exercise appears to
  be \href{http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/dist/README.lastz-1.02.00/README.lastz-1.02.00a.html}{LASTZ}
\item
  Then, you might have to convert the MAF file to a fasta file to feed into something
  like ANGSD. It seems that Dent Earl has some tools that might to do this \href{https://github.com/dentearl/mafTools}{hhttps://github.com/dentearl/mafTools}. Also, the ANGSD github site has a \href{https://github.com/ANGSD/maf2fasta}{maf2fasta} program, though no
  documentation to speak of. Or you might just go ahead and write an awk script to do it.
  Galaxy has a website that will do it: \url{http://mendel.gene.cwru.edu:8080/tool_runner?tool_id=MAF_To_Fasta1}, and there is an alignment too called mugsy
  that has a perl script associated with it that will do it: \url{ftp://188.44.46.157/mugsy_x86-64-v1r2.3/maf2fasta.pl}
  Note that the fasta file for ancestral sequence used by ANGSD just seems to have Ns in the places that don't have alignments.
\end{enumerate}

It will be good to introduce people to those ``dotplots'' that show alignments.

Definitely some discussion of seeding and gap extensions, etc. The LASTZ web page has a
really nice explanation of these things.

The main take home from my explorations here is that there is no way to just toss two
genomes into the blender with default setting and expect that you are going to get
something reasonable out of that. There is a lot of experimentation, it seems to me, and
you really need to know what all the options are (this might be true of just about
everything in NGS analysis, but in many cases people just use the defaults\ldots{}.)

\hypertarget{using-lastz-to-align-coho-to-the-chinook-genome}{%
\subsection{Using LASTZ to align coho to the chinook genome}\label{using-lastz-to-align-coho-to-the-chinook-genome}}

First, compile it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# in: /Users/eriq/Documents/others_code/lastz-1.04.00}
\FunctionTok{make}
\FunctionTok{make}\NormalTok{ install}

\CommentTok{# then I linked those (in bin) to myaliases}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Refreshingly, this has almost no dependencies, and the compilation is super easy.

Now, let's find the coho chromomsome that corresponds to omy28 on NCBI. We can get this
with curl:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# in: /tmp}
\ExtensionTok{curl}\NormalTok{ ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/002/021/735/GCA_002021735.1_Okis_V1/GCA_002021735.1_Okis_V1_assembly_structure/Primary_Assembly/assembled_chromosomes/FASTA/chrLG28.fna.gz -o coho-28.fna.gz}
\FunctionTok{gunzip}\NormalTok{ coho-28.fna.gz}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then, let's also pull that chromosome out of the chinook genome we have:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# in /tmp}
\ExtensionTok{samtools}\NormalTok{ faidx  ~/Documents/UnsyncedData/Otsh_v1.0/Otsh_v1.0_genomic.fna NC_037124.1 }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chinook-28.fna }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Cool, now we should be able to run that:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz chinook-28.fna coho-28.fna --notransition --step=20 --nogapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=maf }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chin28_vs_coho28.maf}

\ExtensionTok{user}\NormalTok{    0m14.198s}
\ExtensionTok{sys}\NormalTok{ 0m0.193s}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

OK, that is ridiculously fast. How about we make a file that we can plot in R?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz chinook-28.fna coho-28.fna --notransition --step=20 --nogapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=rdotplot }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chin28_vs_coho28.rdp}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

I copied that to \texttt{inputs} so we can plot it:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dots <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{readr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{read_tsv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"inputs/chin28_vs_coho28.rdp.gz"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   NC_037124.1 = col_double(),
##   CM007745.1 = col_double()

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(dots,}\DataTypeTok{type=}\StringTok{"l"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{eca-bioinf-handbook_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}

OK, clearly what we have there is just a bunch of repetitive bits. I think we must not have the same chromosomes in the two species.

So, let's put LG28 in coho against the whole chinook genome. Note the use of the
bracketed ``multiple'' in there to let it know that there are multiple sequences in there
that should get catenated together.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz ~/Documents/UnsyncedData/Otsh_v1.0/Otsh_v1.0_genomic.fna[multiple]  coho-28.fna --notransition --step=20 --nogapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=maf }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chin_vs_coho28.maf}

\ExtensionTok{FAILURE}\NormalTok{: in load_fasta_sequence for /Users/eriq/Documents/UnsyncedData/Otsh_v1.0/Otsh_v1.0_genomic.fna, sequence length 2,147,437,804+64,310 exceeds maximum (2,147,483,637)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

No love there. But that chinook genome has a lot of short scaffolds in there too, I think.

Maybe we could just try LG1. Nope. How about we toss every coho LG against LG1 from chinook\ldots{}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# let's get the first 10 linkage groups from coho:}

Nothing looked good until I got to coho LG10:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dots <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{readr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{read_tsv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"inputs/chinook1_vs_coho10.rdp.gz"}\NormalTok{)}

\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(dots,}\DataTypeTok{type=}\StringTok{"l"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There is clearly a big section that aligns there. But, we clearly are going to need to
clean up all the repetive crap, etc on these alignments.

\hypertarget{try-on-the-chinook-chromosomes}{%
\subsection{Try on the chinook chromosomes}\label{try-on-the-chinook-chromosomes}}

So, it crapped out on the full Chinook fasta. Note that I could modify the code (or compile it with a \texttt{-D}): check this out in sequences.h:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{//  Sequence lengths are normally assumed to be small enough to fit into a}
\CommentTok{//  31-bit integer.  This gives a maximum length of about 2.1 billion bp, which}
\CommentTok{//  is half the length of a (hypothetical) monoploid human genome.  The}
\CommentTok{//  programmer can override this at compile time by defining max_sequence_index}
\CommentTok{//  as 32 or 63.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But, for now, I think I will just go for the assembled chromosomes only:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# just get the well assembled chromosomes (about 1.7 Gb)}

\CommentTok{# then try tossing coho 1 against that:}

\end{Shaded}

Here is what the figure looks like. It is clear that the bulk of Chromosome 1
in coho aligns for long distances to two different chromosomes in Chinoook (likely
paralogs?). This is complex!

I am going to use the chinook chromosome 1 and coho 10 to explore things that will
clean up the results a little bit.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# in /tmp}
 \VariableTok{i=}\NormalTok{10; }\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz chinook-1.fna coho-}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{.fna --notransition --step=20 --nogapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=rdotplot }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chinook1_vs_coho}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{.rdp}\KeywordTok{;}
\ExtensionTok{real}\NormalTok{    0m29.055s}
\ExtensionTok{user}\NormalTok{    0m28.497s}
\ExtensionTok{sys}\NormalTok{ 0m0.413s}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

That is quick enough to explore a few things. Note that we are already doing gap-free extension, because
``By default seeds are extended to HSPs using x-drop extension, with entropy adjustment.'' However, by
default, chaining is not done, and that is the key step in which a path is found through the
high-scoring pairs (HSPs). That doesn't take much (any) extra time and totally cleans things up.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\VariableTok{i=}\NormalTok{10; }\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz chinook-1.fna coho-}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{.fna --notransition --step=20 --nogapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=rdotplot --chain  }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chinook1_vs_coho}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{.rdp}\KeywordTok{;}

\ExtensionTok{real}\NormalTok{    0m28.704s}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

So, that is greatly improved:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dots <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{readr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{read_tsv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"inputs/chain-chinook1_vs_coho10.rdp.gz"}\NormalTok{)}

\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(dots,}\DataTypeTok{type=}\StringTok{"l"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

So, it would be worth seeing if chaining also cleans up the multi-chrom alignment:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz chinook_nc_chroms.fna[multiple]  coho-1.fna --notransition --step=20 --nogapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=rdotplot --chain }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chin_nc_vs_coho1.rdp}

\ExtensionTok{real}\NormalTok{    6m42.835s}
\ExtensionTok{user}\NormalTok{    6m35.042s}
\ExtensionTok{sys}\NormalTok{ 0m6.207s}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dots <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{readr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{read_tsv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"inputs/chin_nc_vs_coho1-chain.rdp.gz"}\NormalTok{)}

\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(dots,}\DataTypeTok{type=}\StringTok{"l"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

OK, that shows that it will find crappy chains if given the chance. But if you
zoom in on that stuff you see that some of the spots are pretty short, and some are super
robust. So, we will want some further filtering
to make this work. So, we need to check out the ``back-end filtering.'' that is possible.
Back-end filtering does not happen by default.

Let's say that we want 70 Kb alignment blocks. That is .001 of the total input sequence.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz chinook_nc_chroms.fna[multiple]  coho-1.fna --notransition --step=20 --nogapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=rdotplot --chain --coverage=0.1 }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chin_nc_vs_coho1-cov-0.1.rdp}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

That took 6.5 minutes again. But, it also produced no output whatsoever. We probably
want to filter on identity first anyway. Because that takes so long, maybe we could
do it with our single chromosome first.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\VariableTok{i=}\NormalTok{10; }\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz chinook-1.fna coho-}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{.fna --notransition --step=20 --nogapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=rdotplot --chain  }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chinook1_vs_coho}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{.rdp}\KeywordTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dots <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{readr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{read_tsv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"/tmp/chinook1_vs_coho10-ident95.rdp"}\NormalTok{)}

\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(dots,}\DataTypeTok{type=}\StringTok{"l"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

That keeps things very clean, but the alignment blocks are all pretty short (like 50 to 300
bp long). So perhaps we need to do gapped extension here to make these things better. This
turns out to take a good deal longer.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\VariableTok{i=}\NormalTok{10; }\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz chinook-1.fna coho-}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{.fna --notransition --step=20 --gapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=maf --chain --identity=95  }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chinook1_vs_coho}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{-ident95-gapped.maf}\KeywordTok{;}

\ExtensionTok{real}\NormalTok{    3m15.575s}
\ExtensionTok{user}\NormalTok{    3m14.048s}
\ExtensionTok{sys}\NormalTok{ 0m0.936s}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dots <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{readr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{read_tsv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"/tmp/chinook1_vs_coho10-ident95-gapped.rdp"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(dots,}\DataTypeTok{type=}\StringTok{"l"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

That is pretty clean and slick.

Now, this has got me to thinking that maybe I \emph{can} do this on a chromosome by chromosome basis.

Check what 97\% identity looks like:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\VariableTok{i=}\NormalTok{10; }\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz chinook-1.fna coho-}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{.fna --notransition --step=20 --gapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=rdotplot --chain --identity=97  }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chinook1_vs_coho}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{-ident97-gapped.rdp}\KeywordTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dots <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{readr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{read_tsv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"/tmp/chinook1_vs_coho10-ident97-gapped.rdp"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(dots,}\DataTypeTok{type=}\StringTok{"l"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

That looks to have a few more holes in it.

Final test. Let's see what happens when we chain it on a chromosome that doesn't have
any homology:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# first with no backend filtering}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}

\NormalTok{dots <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{readr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{read_tsv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"/tmp/chinook1_vs_coho1-gapped.rdp"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(dots,}\DataTypeTok{type=}\StringTok{"l"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

OK, it finds something nice and crappy there.

What about if we require 95\% identity?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dots <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{readr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{read_tsv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"/tmp/chinook1_vs_coho1-gapped-ident95.rdp"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(dots,}\DataTypeTok{type=}\StringTok{"l"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

That leaves us with very little.

Let's also try interpolation at the end to see how that does. Note that here we also produce the
rdotplot at the same time as the maf.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\VariableTok{i=}\NormalTok{10; }\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz chinook-1.fna coho-}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{.fna --notransition --step=20 --gapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=maf --rdotplot=chinook1_vs_coho}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{-ident95-gapped-inner1000.rdp --chain --identity=95 --inner=1000 }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chinook1_vs_coho}\VariableTok{$\{i\}}\NormalTok{-ident95-gapped-inner1000.maf}\KeywordTok{;}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

That took an extra minute, but was not so bad.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dots <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{readr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{read_tsv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"/tmp/chinook1_vs_coho10-ident95-gapped-inner1000.rdp"}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{repeat-masking-the-coho-genome}{%
\subsubsection{Repeat Masking the Coho genome}\label{repeat-masking-the-coho-genome}}

Turns out that NCBI site has the repeat masker output in GCF\_002021735.1\_Okis\_V1\_rm.out.gz.
I save that to a shorter name. Now I will make a bed file of the repeat regions. Then I use bedtools maskfasta to softmask that fasta file.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# in: /Users/eriq/Documents/UnsyncedData/Okis_v1}
\ExtensionTok{gzcat}\NormalTok{ Okis_V1_rm.out.gz }\KeywordTok{|} \FunctionTok{awk} \StringTok{'NR>3 \{printf("%s\textbackslash{}t%s\textbackslash{}t%s\textbackslash{}n", $5, $6, $7)\}'} \OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ repeat-regions.bed }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

That works great. But it turns out that the coho genome is already softmasked.

But, it is good to now that I can use a repeat mask output file to toss repeat
sites if I want to for ANGSD analyses, etc.

\hypertarget{multiz-maf2fasta}{%
\subsubsection{multiz maf2fasta}\label{multiz-maf2fasta}}

So, it looks like you can use single\_cov2 from multiz to retain only a single
alignment block covering each area. Then you can maf2fasta that and send it off in
fasta format. Line2 holds the reference (target) sequence, but it has dashes added where
the query has stuff not appearing in the target. So, what you have to do is run through that sequence and drop all the positions in the query that correspond to dashes in the
target. That will get us what we want.

But maybe I can just use megablast like Christensen and company. They have some of their
scripts, but it is not clear to me that it will be easy to get that back to a fasta
for later analysis in ANGSD.

Not only that, but then there is the whole paralog issue. I am exploring that a little
bit right now. It looks like when you crank the identity requirement up, the paralogs
get pretty spotty so they can be easily recognized. For example setting the identity
at 99.5 makes it clear which is the paralog:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{time}\NormalTok{ lastz chinook_nc_chroms.fna[multiple]  coho-1.fna --notransition --step=20 --nogapped --ambiguous=iupac --format=rdotplot --chain --identity=99.5 }\OperatorTok{>}\NormalTok{ chin_nc_vs_coho1-chain-ident-99.5.rdp}
\CommentTok{# takes about 6 minutes}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And the figure is here.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{figs/quickie.jpg}
\caption{Coho Chromo 1 on catenated chinook chromos. Ident=99.5}
\end{figure}

So, I think this is going to be a decent workflow:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  run lastz on each coho linkage group against each chinook chromosome separately. Do this at identity=92 and identity=95 and identity=99.9. For each run, produce a .maf file and
  at the same time a .rdotplot output.
\item
  Combine all the .rdotplot files together into something that can be faceted over
  chromosomes and make a massive facet grid showing the results for all chromosomes.
  Do this at different identity levels so that the paralogs can be distinguished.
\item
  Visually look up each columns of those plots and determine which coho chromosomes
  carry homologous material for each chinook chromosome. For each such chromosome pair,
  run single\_cov2 on them (maybe on the ident=92 version).
\item
  Then merge those MAFs. Probably can just cat them together, but there might be some
  sorting that needs to be done on them.
\item
  Run maf2fasta on those merged mafs to get a fasta for each chinook chromosome.
\item
  Write a C-program that uses uthash to efficiently read the fasta for each chinook
  chromosome and then write out a version in which the positions that are dashes in the
  chinook reference are removed from both the chinook reference and the aligned coho
  sequence. \_Actually, one can just pump each sequence out to a separate file in which
  each site occupies one line. Then paste those and do the comparison\ldots{}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\tightlist
\item
  The coho sequence thus obtained will have dashes anywhere there isn't coho aligned
  to the chinook. So, first, for each chromosome I can count the number of dashes, which
  will tell me the fraction of sites on the chinook genome that were aligned (sort of---there is an issue with N's in the coho genome.) Then those dashes can be converted to N's.
\item
  It would be good to count the number of sites that are not N's in chinook that are also
  not Ns in coho, to know how much of it we have aligned.
\end{enumerate}

Note, the last thing that really remains here is making sure that I can run two or more different query sequences against one chinook genome and then process that out correctly
into a fasta.

Note that Figure 1 in christensen actually gives me a lot to go on in terms of which
chromosomes in coho to map against which ones in chinook.

Standard analyses like computing Fst and linkage disequilibrium, etc., from

Basically, we want to get comfortable with plink 2.0, bedtools, vcftools, etc.

The key in all of this is to motivate every single thing we do here in terms of an
application in conservation genomics. That is going to be key.

This Part IV will be about standard bioinformatic tools for doing things
with big variant data.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Filtering
\item
  Imputation
\item
  LD, HWD, FST
\item
  Etc.

I will probably have a chapter on unix tools.

Maybe another on R/Bioconductor tools.

Gotta have a chapter about ``Look at your data!'' and Whoa! and diagnostics
using radiator.

It would really be good for me to write a chapter / give a few lectures

From Ash's paper: However, population genomic analyses (outlined below) use FST only, as dxy was highly correlated to nucleotide diversity (π) (for early stage diverging populations the correlation between dxy and \(\pi\) is \textgreater{} 0.91, Pearson correlation). As such variation in dxy across the genome reflects variation in diversity, not differentiation (Riesch et al., 2017).
